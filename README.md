Explanation:
The Project basically focuses on the data input by the user such as gender, weight, height, physical activity moderation etc and optimizes it with the help of the software thus providing user, recommendations to improve daily health in various ways. The categories on which user specific suggestions will be provided are water intake, sleep time, calorie intake etc.

Project Structure:
-> User inputs the data.
-> User chooses a category on which he/she requires information.
-> Best recommendation is provided based on the data input.

Core Logic:
The logic behind our software is to ease the lives of people by providing them better and personalised health suggestions at home.
We input a few details from the user and calculate daily water intake, BMI, BMR, calories intake, efficient sleep duration.

Creative Ideas:
Machine learning can play a great role in this software. We can use a particular algorithm to build models which can predict best suggestion based on previous data input by the users. The model will build on its own to provide faster data.
Also a feature related to body temperature and its reaction to the environment will be monitored in every 6 hours. This data will be processed in such a way that it will help user to maintain proper health.

Instructions to set up project:
The Software will be implemented in Android Studio using Kotlin. 
First for the login purpose firebase is being used, firebase is googleâ€™s unique database which make login and sign up easy.
Strong wifi is required.
